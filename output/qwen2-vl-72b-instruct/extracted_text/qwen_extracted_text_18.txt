1. The two most Common tasks are:-
In age recognition and Customer churn Analysis.
2. The purpose of Validation test Set are :-
After analysing the data through trainset and testing set
through test set for multiple times to find the final
Accuracy Validation Set is needed.
3. (i) Coefficient of the Variable.
(ii) Loss function i.e mean Square error (MSE)
(iii) Gradient decent.
4.) AUC value of perfect classifier tanθ=1.
5.) Out of precision, recall, recall is more important for
a spam email detection System.

6.1 Train-test-split:

when we fit get a new dataset, we bar divide the
dataset initially into train-test-split. i.e. 70-80% of data
are kept initially for training and after training the
data model, we use 30-20% of dataset for testing
on this basis, we train the model as well as
test the model Simultaneously, this division of dataset
into 70-30 is splitting of data for the purpose of
training and testing of data.

Overfitting of data: And Underfitting:
In Overfitting of data, we basically try to fit data more
precisely and accurately, we try to Cover each and
every point possible, which is very strict in nature
And, Underfitting of data Says that, we are less
Concerned of Considering dog data, we traverse in
dataset, and whatever number of data we get is
the possible data, But it does not give more,
accurate models, because Sample Size of data
may decrease.

⑧ General algorithm that are available to minimize Cost
function:
→ Naives Bias algorithm
→ Random forest algorithm
→ Decision tree

Cost functions depends on the regression model, we
Select, Cost function may reduce for Some problems
and also may increase for some problem,
Basically, Cost function is low for linear regression
model and at the Same time it is increased
for logistic regression model.

In Linear regression , basically we Simlify the problem
with given Datasets , whichJ takes lead time than
Logistic regression problem , So , it will lower the
Cost function and Simultaneously it will increase
the Cost function for Logistic regression problem.

⑨ Confusion matrix is the essential aspect of training
model, we will get Confusion matrix for every
model , we train . It basically tells about the
model in more details , without Confusion matrix
we Can't be able to tell about the precision,
recall, false negative rate , false positive rate of
model.

Given: TN = 82
FP = 3
FN = 5
TP = 10

false negative rate = FN
                     TN + FN
                    = 5
                      82 + 5
                    = 5
                      87

FNR ≈ 0.05

false positive rate = FP
                     TP + FP
                    = 3
                      10 + 3
                    = 3
                      13

FPR ≈ 0.29

PRECISION = 10
           10 + 3 + 3 + 82
          = 10
            100
          = 0.1

Recall = TP
        TN + TP
       = 10
         82 + 10
       = 10
         92
       = 0.108

(7) Bias and Variance of a Machine Learning model.
- Bias are dataset (how much deviated from the
actual central poi tendevcy)
- Variance is the (how dataset is or far from the
Central nature of a given treaded.

To reduce Bias and Variance, we should avoid:
- overfitting and underfitting
- increase Sample space of datasets
- more frequent train-test-split,

Bias-variance trade off is basically, first we
know how much deviation is there in the
model, then we fix the model by knowing
how far we are from the Central tendency &
of this process is Called Bias-Variance tradeoff.
