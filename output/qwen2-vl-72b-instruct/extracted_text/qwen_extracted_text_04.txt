Part A
Ans 1) Two most common supervised tasks:
(i) Classification
(ii) Regression
Ans 2) Validation set is used to check the accuracy of the
trained model.
Ans 3)-
Ans 4) AUC value of a perfect classifier is 1.
Ans 5) Recall is more important for spam email detection,because,if
gives the ratio of True Positive over True Positive + False Negative.
Meaning predicted true values over actual true values.
Part B
Ans 6) Train-test-split is a function used to split the dataset into
training set and testing set. It is called in python from
sklearn.model_selection. It can use 4 parameters, data, target,
test_size and random_state.
When complex data is used for training
set, the model performs well in training set but poorly on
test set, this condition is known as overfitting.

When less data & or not accurate amount of data is
used for training a model, and @ model performs poorly in
training set as well as testing set, this is known as &
underfitting.

Overfitting can be prevented by cleaning the data and
handling the missing values before training. Underfitting can
be prevented by using @ synthetic data along with
the actual data for training the model.

Ans 7) > when the prediction of model is bent to one side say
the positive side, then the model is bias. Because of this bias,
the accuracy of the model is reduced.
when there is a huge deflection in
the output for slight change in the input, this is known
as variance

when the bias and variance both are very
close to each other, this is known as bias-variance trade-off.
Bias and variance can be reduced by cleaning
and preprocessing the @ dataset before training the
model. This helps reduce the bias and variance of the model
and helps improve accuracy and performance.

Ans 9) > Confusion Matrix is used to display the accuracy of the
model by showing the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives, false negatives values of the
predicted outcome. It is an important function of
machine learning. as it helps to understand the accuracy
@ and performance of the trained model. It
displays the above data in a metrics format.
fn = 5 , fp = 3 , tp = 10 , tn = 82
precision = dp / tp + fp = 10 / 10+3 = [10/13]

Recall = dp = 10 = 10 = [2]
        fp+fn 10+5 15   3

false negative rate = fn = 5 = [5]
                     fn+tn 5+82 87

false positive rate = dp = 3 = [3]
                      dp+fp 3+10 13

Any 10) > AUC stands for Area under the curve. It is calculated to measure the performance of the model.
Roc is also calculated to measure the performance of the model.
