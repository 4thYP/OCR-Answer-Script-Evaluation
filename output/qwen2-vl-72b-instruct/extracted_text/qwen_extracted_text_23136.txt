Part A

1. The two most Common Supervised tasks
are Regression and classification.

2. The purpose of a validation set
is used after training the model. It is
used to evaluate the model performance
and tuning the model.

3. 2 model parameters are there in
a linear regression problem with a
single feature variable.

4. The AUC value of a perfect classifier
is  1.

5. Precision is more important for a
spam email detection system.

Part B

6) train-test-split:
The dataset is splitted into training,
testing and validation.
The model trained on training set,
then the model is tested on unseen
test dataset.

Overfitting:
When a model learn noise from
the training set and model performea
well in training set but itdoes not-
perform well on unseen data. This
indicates overfitting.

underfitting:
when a model is unable to learn
from the trainingset and the model
perform does not well on training
set. This Calted under-fitting.

Prevent them:
a) use a good model
b) Reduce the noise data.
c) scale the data.
d) Cross-validation.

g) Confusion matrix:
Confusion matrix is the insight
of model performance. It computes
includes correctly and incorrectly
predicted data value.
It is important:
a) It can check accuracy
from matrix.

b) It can calculate Entraopy.
c) It also can calculate precision,
recall, f-Score.


tn=82 precision = TP
fp =3        = 10   = 10/13
fn =5        10+3
TP = 10                 =0.769


Recall = TP = 10 =10=0.666
TP+FN 10+5  15
false negative rate = FPn = 5 =5
TP+FN   10+5=13
false positive rate = FP = 3    = 3
fp+TN  3+82 = 85
= 1 - precision = 1 - 0.769 = 0.231 = 0.035


7) In machine Learning model,
Bias is a training terminology
in machine Learning. it signifies
a training model performing poorly
in training phase.
variance is where the model
mostly give some error in testing
phase.

It reduces-
a) to reduce, it take data that
it is properly scaled ana the size
of data is measured
b) to reduce variance, it can
use dimansionalty reduction.

Bias-Variance tradeoff is a senario
where the model perform poorly
in the trainina phase.
