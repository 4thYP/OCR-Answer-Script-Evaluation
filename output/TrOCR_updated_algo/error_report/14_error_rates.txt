Part A
1. Two most common supervised tasks are -
Regression
Classification
3. There are 2 model parameters in a linear regression problem with a single feature variable.
They are intercept and co-efficient.
2. The main purpose of validation set is that it is used to evaluate the performance of a model.
5. Precision is more important for a spam e-mail detection.
4. The AUC value of a perfect classifier is: 1.
Part B
6). Train-test-split is a model that is used to divide the dataset into training dataset and testing dataset
Implementation: From sklearn.model_selection, import train_test_split, x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split (x, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 42)
Overfitting is a problem that occurs in a training model where it can predict accurately for data in a dataset but fail on real world data.
Underfitting makes the training model such way that it can predict accurately for real world data
Prevention:
Prunning,
Using right machine learning algorithm,
Scaling of data.
8). Linear Regression is supervised algorithm where output a dependent variable is found from one or more independent variable
a → intercept, b → slope
  y → dependent variable
  x → independent variable
The cost function / Loss function for linear regression is :
Logistic regression is a supervised algorithm where it is mainly used for the classification, i.e. classifying the data into their respective classes.
The cost function / loss function of Logistic regression is:
The General Algorithm by which lort function are minimized are Lasss Regression & Ridge regression
Here is absolute value of .
Here is a squared value of .
